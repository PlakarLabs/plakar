	//
	// 1. fetch all snapshot indexes to figure out which blobs, objects and chunks are used
	// 2. blobs that are no longer in use can be be removed
	// 3. for each object and chunk, track which packfiles contain them
	// 4. if objects or chunks are present in more than one packfile...
	// 5. decide which one keeps it and a new packfile has to be generated for the other that contains everything BUT the object/chunk
	// 6. update indexes to reflect the new packfile
	// 7. save the new index
